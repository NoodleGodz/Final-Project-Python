## Build instruction

Of course, Python 3 is necessary.

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/rashlight/Final-Project-Python
cd Final-Project-Python
```

Next, install necessary PySide components:
``` 
pip install pyside6 
```

Then run and hope you installed all dependencies :)
```
python3 main.py
```

It is also recommended to use Qt Creator and Qt Designer (>= 6.0.0) to build. 
If that's the case, open the ```main.py``` file and press Run/Debug button instead.

## Troubleshooting

 - If there are errors on your fonts, try installing Segoe UI family and try again
